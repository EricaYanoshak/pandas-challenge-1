# Title: Pandas Challenge 1
This week's project focused on data analysis with Python's Pandas library, which involved examining, cleaning, processing, and extracting useful information from large datasets. 

# Description: Preparing Data with Pandas: Part 1
Using the provided dataset from a fictional e-commerce company, this project consisted of exploring and analyzing data to address real-world business questions about product sales, client totals, and profit. This is accomplished through creating new columns, sorting and filtering data, creating summary dataframes, and defining custom functions. Such actions were completed via the following sections of the project:
1. Part 1: Explore the Data
    * Import the data and use Pandas to learn more about the dataset

2. Part 2: Transform the Data
    * Transform the data for better and easier analysis

3. Part 3: Confirm Your Work
    * Verify the results

4. Part 4: Summarize and Analyze
    * Find additional information


# Challenges
I ran into issues in Part 4 when it came to defining and applying the convert to millions instruction. After trying for hours to complete this using the define function to all columns that needed to be converted, I applied the currency conversion to each individual column that called for it and copied the summarized dataframe to only account for the columns called for. I kept all of my work which is noted in the project.
